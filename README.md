# Etch-a-Sketch project

In this project I created a sketch pad with HTML CSS and JS. It works by creating a "sketchpad" area made up of lots of square divs. 
When the pen is turned on (this is toggled by clicking) the divs change to the selected color when hovered over.[^1]

things that can be imporved on this project:
-Scaling the board and elements.

[^1]:To make this project I got the idea from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch),
    with some help from this [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyhuaXeuyGo).
