## Features
1. **Interactive Drawing Board:** The board is composed of a grid of squares. By turning on the pen (which is toggled by clicking anywhere on the screen that's not a button), you can change the color of the squares by hovering over them.

2. **Color Options:** You can choose to color your art with Black, White, Cyan, Yellow, and Magenta. There's also a Rainbow option that colors each square with a random color from the rainbow.

3. **Reset Board:** This feature allows you to clear the entire board to start a new masterpiece. 

4. **Adjustable Board Size:** The size of the board can be adjusted by setting the desired number of squares (from 2 to 100).
