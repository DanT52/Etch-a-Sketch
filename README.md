2. **Color Options:** You can choose to color your art with Black, White, Cyan, Yellow, and Magenta. There's also a Rainbow option that colors each square with a random color from the rainbow.

3. **Reset Board:** This feature allows you to clear the entire board to start a new masterpiece. 

4. **Randomize Board** This feature allows you to set the board to have a randomly colored background.

5. **Adjustable Board Size:** The size of the board can be adjusted by setting the desired number of squares (from 2 to 100).
